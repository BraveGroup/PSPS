#### Pointly-Supervised Panoptic Segmentation (ECCV 2022 Oral)

---

Panoptic segmentation with a single point label per target!

Here are all the codes to reproduce the results. We are still cleaning them and will update later.

The code is based on the implementation of [Panoptic SegFormer](https://github.com/zhiqi-li/Panoptic-SegFormer).

The point labels used in the paper can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19qBN_da_icbXvMFjlFtz4y24CN2MAvXB?usp=sharing).

**TODO**

- [ ] clean code
- [ ] update README.md
